# Tests for the STLXML-SplitBlocks module
The folder `test_files` contains XML documents that can be used as test
input for the `STLXML-SplitBlocks` module.

The folder `schema` contains for each test file a corresponding
Schematron document.

The result of processing a test file shall always validate against the
corresponding Schematron schema.

The corresponding requirements can be found [here](../documentation/requirements_stlxml_splitblocks.pdf).
